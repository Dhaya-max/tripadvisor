TripAdvisor Web Page â€“ Project Description
This project is a responsive single-page web layout inspired by the TripAdvisor travel platform. Built using only HTML and CSS, it aims to visually represent a travel-focused interface where users can explore destinations, read reviews, and plan their trips.

The page includes the following key sections:

Header and Navigation Bar: Featuring a clean logo, navigation links like "Hotels", "Restaurants", "Things to Do", and a search bar for user convenience.

Hero Section: A full-width banner showcasing scenic travel imagery and a prominent search input for exploring destinations.

Popular Destinations Grid: A visually consistent gallery displaying top travel locations with images, names, and star ratings.

Review Highlights: A section with user testimonial-style cards, mimicking the review culture TripAdvisor is known for.

Footer: Includes links to customer service, terms, social media icons, and newsletter sign-up.

The design emphasizes usability and aesthetic, with CSS used to handle layout (Flexbox/Grid), hover effects, responsive scaling, and consistent typography.

This project demonstrates a practical use of semantic HTML5 elements, clean CSS styling, and layout techniques to create a modern travel web interface.
